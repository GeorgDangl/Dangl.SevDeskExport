# Dangl.SevDeskExport

This is a small CLI tool that exports all data from your sevDesk account.

## CLI Usage

Simply execute the converter, e.g. on Windows:

    Dangl.SevDeskExport.exe -t <ApiToken> -f <OutputFolder>

The data will be exported to a new folder generated in the `OutputFolder`. If no folder is specified, it's placed relative to the executable.
